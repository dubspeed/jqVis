The JQuery Visualizer

I wrote this little tool to dive deeper into JS and jquery. The Tool aims to help you create you Jquery selection live online.
All you need to do is paste your html file into the texteditor and write you queries on it.

The software renders your webpage live in the right frame and highlights your sourcecode as you write queries in the left frame.

Lets take a look into the code and see how it works:

I am going to apply the MVC pattern, splitting the code into a model, view and controller section. 
I keep the model and the data out of the DOM which differ from the naive implementation of the solution.

The Model
- keep state: handle secret_dom / and or the highlights and selected jquery results

model class:
Handle state and data:
    secret_dom: {}
    query_result: {}    // last result
    query: string       // the current query -> = input element?
    uploaded_html: {}   // editor content 

View
- handle events like show, click, toggle etc. 
- user input handling and communication towards the user
- most jquery calls should get handled here 

Controller 
- handle jquery calls (loosely coupled ? -> stubbing?)
- build view and DOM from model (inject html from model into iframe)
- create results and operate on the model
- have interface towards view
  what interface?
    setData = takes html code from the editor and stores it into the mode
    query = execute a jquery on the model and return a result
    render = returns the dom from the model to render in the iframe
